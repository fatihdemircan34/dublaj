1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,000
I've also eaten, um...

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,980
Vegan sausage rolls.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,340
Have you eaten a vegan sausage roll?

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,700
I've not, but it's meant to be a monster hit for that bakery chain, isn't it?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,300
I don't know why people...

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,220
Why are you laughing for?

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,500
Chris, why are you laughing for?

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,320
Why are you laughing for?

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm being serious!

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm being serious!

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,140
No, you see...

12
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,560
No, you see, I'm talking facts here.

13
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,920
I don't do if, buts and maybes.

14
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,040
I do absolutes.

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,020
And, you know, like, if your aunt had balls, she'd be your uncle.

16
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,460
But she doesn't, so she's not.

17
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,820
Do you know what I'm trying to say?

18
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,100
Who?  Exactly.

19
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,200
Who?  He knows.

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,280
My man knows.

21
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,960
Do you know what I mean?

22
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,480
Listen.

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,520
Does Brexit make my passport expire?

24
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,080
No.

25
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,280
But it does mean that you are entitled to a beautiful new blue passport.

26
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,140
Tomorrow.

27
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:47,320
Tomorrow.

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,140
Tomorrow.

29
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:49,900
Tomorrow.

30
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,720
Tomorrow.

31
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:53,060
It's tomorrow.

32
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
No, it's tomorrow.

33
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,980
Butter.

34
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,600
Butter.

35
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,520
Butter.

36
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,100
Butter.

37
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,260
Listen.

38
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,220
Butter.

39
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,280
Butter.

40
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:03,640
That's it.

41
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:04,640
Say it again.

42
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,440
Butter.

43
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,720
In the run-up to any competition, Danny's trainer puts him on a strict diet.

44
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,280
Eight o'clock in the morning, I'll have fish and a rice cake.

45
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,720
At ten o'clock, I'll have fish.

46
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:21,620
At twelve o'clock, I'll have fish and a rice cake.

47
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,140
At two o'clock, I'll have fish.

48
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,900
At four o'clock, just before a train, I'll have fish and a rice cake.

49
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,060
I'll train.

50
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
I'll have me fish.

51
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:38,160
I'll come home, have some more fish.

52
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,560
So this is my lovely, lovely dress.

53
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,280
Loved my dress.

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
White was obviously a bit dodgy.

55
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,520
Can you see the yellow stains and all sorts of stuff?

56
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,580
Now, before you jump to any conclusions where these mysterious yellow stains might have come from,

57
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,920
I can tell you that those are in fact mustard and pick a lily.

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,520
Woah, woah, woah.

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
Mysterious girl.

60
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,640
Move your body close to mine.

61
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,620
Come on, move your body.

62
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,040
Come on, move your body.

63
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,100
I stop and stare at you.

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
Walking on the shore.

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,380
I try to concentrate.

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,300
My mind wants to explore.

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,420
To explore.  The tropical scene of you takes me up above.

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,820
And girl, when I look at you, oh, I fall in love.

69
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,060
No doubt you look so fine.

70
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,860
Woah.

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,660
Girl, I want to make you mine.

72
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,580
Yeah, come on.

73
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,220
Just let me be with the woman that I love.

74
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,240
The woman that I love.

75
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,440
Where's the lamb sauce?

76
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,380
Come on, man.

77
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
I just need it.

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,480
There's the lamb sauce.

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
Where's the lamb sauce?

80
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,360
Do you think these **** are going to pay my mortgage?

81
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
I've got money.

82
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Listen, Gemma.

83
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm claustrophobic, Darren.

84
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,280
Listen.

85
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,820
They don't get it.

86
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,460
I'm claustrophobic.

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,500
The voting lines have officially closed.

88
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,280
The votes have been counted and verified.

89
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,660
Could you please have quiet in the studio?

90
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,224
Quite please.

91
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,991
**** shut up!

92
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,900
Thank you.

93
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,794
Message?

94
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,285
Oh, from Michelle.

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,220
How very amusing.

96
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Say, would you like to watch it together?

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,160
Yes.

98
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,920
Let's have a look.

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Hey, Prince Harry.

100
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,160
Remember when you told us to bring it at the Invictus Games?

101
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,740
Careful what you wish for.

102
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,203
Boom.

103
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,473
Oh, really?

104
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:35,020
Please.

105
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:36,049
Boom.

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,240
My name is Jonathan Pye and that was the **** news.

107
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,340
Mr. Broccoli, you went viral on the internet

108
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,620
because you were arrested and you were a piece of broccoli.

109
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,540
Yes.

110
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,040
Do you identify as broccoli?

111
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,780
I am Mr. Broccoli, yes.

112
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,680
Yes, that's right, please.

113
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,960
Do you have another name or not?

114
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,380
No, Mr. Broccoli is...

115
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,620
That's it.

116
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,900
You don't go about your daily business as a piece of broccoli.

117
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,580
I've always been a piece of broccoli.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,660
Really?  Yeah.

119
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,080
Oh, yeah.

120
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,780
Yeah.

121
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,320
Right.

122
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,520
So do you have a job?

123
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:13,160
I just grow.

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,320
Do you know who I am?

125
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,152
Do I care?

126
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,660
Well, you will when you pull up.

127
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:19,860
Come on, who are you then?

128
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,680
Ronan Bickering.

129
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,100
Who?  Ronan Bickering.

130
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,680
Who?  Ronan Bickering.

131
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,740
Who the **** is that?

132
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,320
Yeah, me.

133
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,860
Oh, wow.

134
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,440
Yeah.

135
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,860
Brilliant.

136
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,400
That's literally the first thing I do.

137
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,046
There's always one.

138
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:34,940
I'm going to chop the end of my finger off.

139
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,400
Might have to sit outside for a bit.

140
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,180
A bit like...

141
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
Keep walking.

142
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,080
Slowly.

143
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,534
Oh, dear.
